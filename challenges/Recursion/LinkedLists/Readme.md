A lot of problems involving Linked Lists can be solved but iteratively as well as Recursively. 

If you are still new to Linked Lists, you may benefit from revising the basics and first attempting the solutions iteratively.
The iterative approaches for some common Linked List callenges may be found on https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeBoston/algorithms/tree/master/challenges
