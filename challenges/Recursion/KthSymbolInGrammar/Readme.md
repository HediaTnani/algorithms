# kth symbol in grammar

## Exercise
* Design and author a method that returns the kth symbol in the nth row per the following rules
* On the first row, we write a 0. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10.
* Given row N and index K, return the K-th indexed symbol in row N. (The values of K are 1-indexed.) (1 indexed).
* Note: N will be an integer in the range [1, 30].
* Note: K will be an integer in the range [1, 2^(N-1)].
