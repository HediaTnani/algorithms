Theme: **Linked Lists**

## Slides on "Linked List - quick revision"
From the event, here's the [slide deck on a quick revision of linked list data structure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bEGgxFTixxhuEIvqfNrdpqxKhNGctKL-/view?usp=sharing)

## Interview knowledge questions
These questions seek to judge your understanding of CS Fundamentals and of the primary programming language of your choice.

Explain the following:
- Compare an array and linked list data structure. When would you use one over the other?
- What is the difference between a **pointer** and a **reference**?
- What is a **memory Access Violation** or **AV**?
- What is a **memory leak**? What's the harm with memory leaks?
- Does *<fill in your primary programming language of choice>, e.g. Java or Ruby*, provide an implementation of LinkedList as part of the common library?
- Does *<fill in your primary programming language of choice>, e.g. Java or Ruby*, have a garbage collector? How does the garbage collector work?

## Interview coding problems:
Given a singly linked list
- [Delete a node in the linked list (except if it is the tail). Return the head to the modified linked list.](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeBoston/algorithms/tree/master/challenges/DeleteNodeInLinkedList)
- [Delete nth node from the end of a linked list. Return the head to the modified linked list](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeBoston/algorithms/tree/master/challenges/RemoveNthFromEnd)
- [Reverse the linked list. Return the head to the modified linked list.](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeBoston/algorithms/tree/master/challenges/ReverseLinkedList)
- [Merge two sorted lists. Return the head to the linked list.](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeBoston/algorithms/tree/master/challenges/MergeSortedList)
- [Check if the linked list has values that form a palindrome. Return true if it does, no if it doesn't.](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeBoston/algorithms/tree/master/challenges/PalindromeLinkedList)
- [Detect if the linked list has a cycle. Return true if it does, no if it doesn't.](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeBoston/algorithms/tree/master/challenges/DetectCycle)

Given a singly linked list with integer values constrained to 1, 2 and 3. 
- Sort the linked list so that all the nodes with value 1 come before the nodes with the value 2 and all nodes with the value 3 are in the end of the linked list. Return the head of the modified linked list.

Given a singly linked list, detect if the linked list has a cycle and return the node at which the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
